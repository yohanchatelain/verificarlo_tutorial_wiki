# Objectives
Compile your first program using Verificarlo Tool. 

# Description
To debug or optimize floating-point computation with Verificarlo, the first step is to compile your program with it. Verificarlo is built as a set of LLVM plugins; to compile a program with verificarlo you should use the `verificarlo` command instead of the usual `clang`, `icc` or `gcc`.

# Exercice 1
Open an editor and copy/paste the following simple C program.
```C
#include<stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char ** charv){
   double a,b,c;

   a=1;
   b=2;
   c=a+b;
   printf("%e + %e = %e\n",a,b,c);
}
```

Then compile the program using Verificarlo:

```
$ verificarlo test.c -o test
```

and run your program

```
$ ./test
```

You should get an error as the VFC_BACKENDS environment variable is empty. The simplest backend is the one emulating
IEEE-754 arithmetic(`libinterflop_ieee.so`). It has a `--debug` option that trace each instrumented floating-point
operations.

# Exercice 2
Once a program is compiled with Verificarlo, you can load various backends to
simulate round-off noise or the effect of lower floating-point precisions. Backends are selected and configured by defining the `VFC_BACKENDS` environment variable.

Run the program using the IEEE backend,
```
$ VFC_BACKENDS="libinterflop_ieee.so --debug" ./test
```
Congratulation, now you should see the execution trace of your program for each executed floating-point operations.
