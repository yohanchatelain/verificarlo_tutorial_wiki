# Objectives
Compile your first program using Verificarlo Tool

# Description
To debug or optimize floating-point computation with Verificarlo, the first step is to compile your program with it. Verificarlo is built as a set of LLVM plugins; to compile a program with verificarlo you should use the `verificarlo` command instead of the usual `clang`, `icc` or `gcc`.

Once a program is compiled with Verificarlo, you can load various backends to
simulate round-off noise or the effect of lower floating-point precisions. Backends are selected and configured by defining the `VFC_BACKENDS` environment variable.
