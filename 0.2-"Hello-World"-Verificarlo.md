# Objectives
Compile your first program using Verificarlo Tool. 

# Description
To debug or optimize floating-point computation with Verificarlo, the first step is to compile your program with it. Verificarlo is built as a set of LLVM plugins; to compile a program with verificarlo you should use the `verificarlo` command instead of the usual `clang`, `icc` or `gcc`.

| Exercice 1 |
|:------------|

Open an editor and copy/paste the following simple C program.
```C
#include<stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char ** charv){
 float f;
 double d;
 int i;
 
 for (i=0, f = 0.0; f < 1.0; f += 0.1) { i++;}
 printf("float : %d \n",i);

 for (i=0, d = 0.0; d < 1.0; d += 0.1) { i++;}
 printf("double : %d \n",i);
 return 1;
}
```

Then compile the program using Verificarlo:

```
$ verificarlo exercice1.c -o exercice1
```

and run your program

```
$ ./exercice1
```

You should get the following error as the VFC_BACKENDS environment variable is empty. 
```
test: VFC_BACKENDS is empty, at least one backend should be provided
```

| Exercice 2 |
|:------------|

Once a program is compiled with Verificarlo, you can load various backends to simulate round-off noise or the effect of lower floating-point precisions. Backends are selected and configured by defining the `VFC_BACKENDS` environment variable.
The simplest backend is the one emulating IEEE-754 arithmetic(`libinterflop_ieee.so`). 

Run the program using the IEEE backend,
```
$ VFC_BACKENDS="libinterflop_ieee.so" ./test
```
Congratulation, now you should see the execution trace of your program for each executed floating-point operations.
