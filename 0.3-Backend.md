# Objectives
1. Understand the backend concept
1. Evaluate possible usage of each back-end
1. Perturbate floating-point data and operations to estimate rounding error.

# Description
Verificarlo generate an executable where floating-point operations are replaced with calls to functions.
These functions can perform various analyses and are distributed as dynamic libraries also named **backend** according to their features. They are loaded with the environment variable `VFC_BACKENDS`.

The available backend are
* `libinterflop_ieee.so`
* `libinterflop_mca.so`
* `ibinterflop_mca_mpfr.so`

Backends can be configured by passing command line arguments after each backend.

# Exercice 1: `libinterflop_ieee.so`
`libinterflop_ieee.so is the simplest backend that emulates IEEE-754 arithmetic. 
It has 2 options:
*  `--debug` option that trace each instrumented floating-point operations.
*  `--debug_binary` option that trace in binary each instrumented floating-point operations.

Open an editor and copy/paste the following simple C program.
```C
#include<stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char ** charv){
 float f, f_inc;
 double d, d_inc;
 int i;

 f_inc=0.1;
 d_inc=0.1;

 for (i=0, f = 0.0; f < 1.0; f += f_inc) { printf("(FLOAT)Iter %d \n",i++);}
 printf("float : %d \n",i);

 for (i=0, d = 0.0; d < 1.0; d += d_inc) { printf("(DOUBLE)Iter %d \n",i++);}
 printf("double : %d \n",i);
 return 1;
}
````

Then compile and run the program using Verificarlo using the decimal/binary debug mode. 
Observe what is happening at iteration NÂ°9 and explains the divergence.

```
$ verificarlo exercice1.c -o exercice
$ VFC_BACKENDS="libinterflop_ieee.so --debug" ./exercice1
$ VFC_BACKENDS="libinterflop_ieee.so --debug_binary" ./exercice1
```



```C
#include<stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char ** charv){
   int i=0;

   float f = 1.0;
   for (i = 0; 1.0f + f != 1.0f; i++) {
      f /= 2.;
   }

   printf("The number of digits to represent a float is %d \n",i);

   double d = 1.0;
   for (i = 0; 1.0d + d != 1.0d; i++) {
      d /= 2.;
   }

   printf("The number of digits to represent a double is %d \n",i);

   do{
   }while( a==b )
}
```

Then compile and run the program using Verificarlo:

```
$ verificarlo test.c -o test
$ ./test
```

# Exercice 2: `libinterflop_mca.so`
To estimate the numerical error, we will now use the Monte Carlo Arithmetic backend (`libinterflop_mca.so`) in
single precision by simulating round-o errors that could occurs at 24 bits of precision.


# Exercice 3: `libinterflop_mca_mpfr.so`

# Exercice 4: Combination of back-end
Multiple backends can be loaded at the same time; they will be chained in the order of appearance in the VFC_BACKENDS variable. They must be separated with semi-colons,
