Formal methods are the classical tools for determining conditionedness of a problem. 
Another solution consists on relying on Monte Carlo (probabilistic) techniques.

# Exercice
Running several instance of the program with slightly perturbated input data.
If all the instance give similar solutions then the original problem is likely to be well-conditioned. 
If not, then, you have at least been warned of the instability.
