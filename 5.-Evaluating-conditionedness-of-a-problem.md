Formal methods are the classical tools for determining conditionedness of a problem. 
Another solution consists on relying on Monte Carlo (probabilistic) techniques.

The goal of this exercice is to understand that Verificarlo is intended to helps users to catch how a change on the input(s) and internal operations affects the output. 
Hence it also helps to determine how input error bars and internal operations become output error bars. 

# Exercice
We are going to use Verificarlo to automatically perturbate input data and observe the impact on the output.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

#define N 2

float mat[N][N]=
  {{1.7711,1.0946},
   {0.6765,0.4181}};
/*
float mat[N][N]=
 {{2,6},
  {6,-3}};
*/

float vec[N]={34,18};

void printmat(){
  for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
    for(int j=0;j<N;j++){
      printf("%e \t",mat[i][j]);
    }
    printf(" = %e \n",vec[i]);
  }
}

void solver(){
  int i,ii,j;
  float c;

  for(i=0; i<N; i++){
    for(ii=i+1; ii<N; ii++){
      c = mat[ii][i] / mat[i][i];
      for(j=i; j<N; j++){
        mat[ii][j] =  mat[ii][j] - c * mat[i][j];
      }
      vec[ii] = vec[ii] - c * vec[i];
    }
  }

  for(i=N-1;i>=0;i--){
    vec[i] /= mat[i][i];
    mat[i][i] = 1;
    for(j=i-1;j>=0;j--){
      vec[j] -= vec[i]*mat[j][i];
      mat[j][i] = 0;
    }
  }
}

int main(){

  printf("Initial system\n");
  printmat();
  solver();
  printf("Solved System\n");
  printmat();
}
```

1. Consider the previous program that solve a linear system and analyse its numerical behaviour for the system [[2,6],[6,-3]]=[34,18] and for [[1.7711,1.0946],[0.6765,0.4181]]=[34,18].
2. Can you get an hint on the conditioning of this problem using Verificarlo?  

# Discussion
If all the instance give similar solutions then the original problem is likely to be well-conditioned. 
If not, then, you have at least been warned of the instability.
