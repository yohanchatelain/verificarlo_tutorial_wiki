# Exercice 
Compile this program with `Verificarlo`
```C
double x = 10.0/9.0;
for (i=0; i<30; i++)
{ printf("%e\n", x);
x = (x-1.0) * 10.0;
}
```
Observe the result, is it what was expect ?

## Discussion
This is called cancellation or *gradual loss of significance*. 
We are now going to observe this program behaviour using Verificarlo.
