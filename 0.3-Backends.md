# Objectives
1. Understand the backend concept
1. Evaluate possible usage of each backend
1. Perturbate floating-point data and operations to estimate rounding error.

# Description
Verificarlo generate an executable where floating-point operations are replaced with calls to functions.
These functions can perform various analyses and are distributed as dynamic libraries also named **backend** according to their features. They are loaded with the environment variable `VFC_BACKENDS`.

The available backend are
* `libinterflop_ieee.so`
* `libinterflop_mca.so`
* `ibinterflop_mca_mpfr.so`

Backends can be configured by passing command line arguments after each backend.

# Exercice 1: `libinterflop_ieee.so`
`libinterflop_ieee.so` is the simplest backend that emulates IEEE-754 arithmetic. 
It has 2 options:
*  `--debug` option that trace each instrumented floating-point operations.
*  `--debug_binary` option that trace in binary each instrumented floating-point operations.

Open an editor and copy/paste the following simple C program.

| exercice1.c |
| -------- |
```C
#include<stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char ** charv){
 float f, f_inc;
 double d, d_inc;
 int i;

 f_inc=0.1;
 d_inc=0.1;

 for (i=0, f = 0.0; f < 1.0; f += f_inc) 
   printf("(FLOAT)Iter %d \n",i++);
 printf("Nb of iteration with float : %d \n",i);

 for (i=0, d = 0.0; d < 1.0; d += d_inc) 
   printf("(DOUBLE)Iter %d \n",i++);
 printf("Nb of iteration with double : %d \n",i);
 return 0;
}
````

Then compile and run the program using Verificarlo using the decimal/binary debug mode. 

```
$ verificarlo exercice1.c -o exercice
$ VFC_BACKENDS="libinterflop_ieee.so --debug" ./exercice1
$ VFC_BACKENDS="libinterflop_ieee.so --debug_binary" ./exercice1
```

1. Observe what is happening at iteration NÂ°9 and explains the divergence.
2. Replace the increment `f_inc` and `d_inc` in the for loop by the corresponding value `0.1` and observe what is happening. Then try again with `0.1f`.


***

# Exercice 2: `libinterflop_mca.so`

`libinterflop_mca.so` is the backend that emulates Monte Carlo Arithmetic (MCA). 
It has 3 options:
* `--mode=MODE` option to select the MCA mode with MODE selected among {`ieee`,`mca`,`pb`,`rr`}. 
* `--precision=PREC` option to select the precision at which the MCA operates.
* `--seed=SEED` option that fix the random generator seed.

| exercice2.c |
| -------- |
```C
#include<stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char ** charv){
   int i=0;

   float f = 1.0;
   for (i = 0; 1.0f + f > 1.0f; i++) 
      f /= 2.;

   printf("The number of digits to represent a float is %d \n",i);

   double d = 1.0;
   for (i = 0; 1.0 + d > 1.0; i++) 
      d /= 2.;

   printf("The number of digits to represent a double is %d \n",i);
   return 0;
}
```

1.  Compile and run this program using the `libinterflop_mca.so` backend with `ieee` mode. With this mode, floating-point operations behave similarly to IEEE arithmetic. Does the output corresponds to the expected results ?
```
$ verificarlo exercice2.c -o exercice2
$ VFC_BACKENDS="libinterflop_mca.so --mode=ieee" ./exercice2
```
2.  Then run this program using MCA arithmetic with `precision` set to 15 bits. This corresponds to the introduction of random noise at `15` bits for each operations. Executes this programs multiple times, what do you observe ? Try setting precision to `45`, `60` is there a change ?
```
$ VFC_BACKENDS="libinterflop_mca.so --precision=15" ./exercice2
$ VFC_BACKENDS="libinterflop_mca.so --precision=45" ./exercice2
$ VFC_BACKENDS="libinterflop_mca.so --precision=60" ./exercice2
```



To estimate the numerical error, we will now use the Monte Carlo Arithmetic backend (`libinterflop_mca.so`) in
single precision by simulating round-o errors that could occurs at 24 bits of precision.

# Exercice 3: `libinterflop_mca_mpfr.so`

***

# Exercice 4: Combination of back-end
Multiple backends can be loaded at the same time; they will be chained in the order of appearance in the VFC_BACKENDS variable. They must be separated with semi-colons,
