# Objectives
Understand the effect of biaised rounding.

# Exercices 
Rounding to the nearest is the default rounding mode as it is the one that minimizes the rounding error.

1. Analyse this program. What is the exact mathematical result?
| biaisedrounding.c |
| -------- |
```C
#include<stdio.h>

// 2^53 in order to use the hardware rounding to nearest integer
#define SPLIT +1p53 

double nearest_euro(double d){
 return ((d+SPLIT)-SPLIT);
}

int main(int argc, char ** charv){
 double r=1.0;
 int i;
 for(i=0; i<100; i++)
   r = nearest_euro(r + 0.3);  
}
```
2. Compile and run it with your favorite compiler (ex: gcc), what do you get? 
3. Then run it with verificarlo with `mca` mode what to you get, explain it?
