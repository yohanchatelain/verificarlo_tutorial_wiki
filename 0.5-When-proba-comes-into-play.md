# Objectives
Understand the effect of biaised rounding.

# Exercices 
Rounding to the nearest is the default rounding mode as it is the one that minimizes the rounding error.

1. Analyse this program. What is the exact mathematical result?
| biaisedrounding.c |
| -------- |
```C
#include<stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char ** charv){
 double inc = 0.3;
 int i, r;
 for(i=0;i<100;i++)
   r = (int)(r + 0.3);  
}
```
2. Compile and run it with your favorite compiler (ex: gcc), what do you get? 
3. Then run it with verificarlo with `mca` mode what to you get, explain it?
