# Objectives
Understand the effect of biaised rounding.

# Exercices 
Rounding to the nearest is the default rounding mode as it is the one that minimizes the rounding error.

Let say we wrote the following program to apply during 100 months, every month a 30 cents increment to a given price rounded to the nearest euro. We are smart programmers and used the default rounding mode available in hardware which is the rounding to the nearest.

1. Analyse this program. What is the exact mathematical result?

| biaisedrounding.c |
| -------- |
```C
#include<stdio.h>

// 2^53 in order to use the hardware rounding to nearest integer
#define SPLIT 0x1.0p52

double nearest_euro(double d){
 return ((d+SPLIT)-SPLIT);
}

int main(int argc, char ** charv){
 double r=1.0;
 int i;
 for(i=0; i<100; i++){
   price = nearest_euro(price + 0.4);
   printf("Month %d: The new price is %g \n", i, price);
  }
 return 0;
}
```
2. Compile and run it with your favorite compiler (ex: gcc), what do you get? 
3. Then compile it with Verificarlo, and run it with `mca`, 'rr', mode. Is the result closer to the mathematical results?
