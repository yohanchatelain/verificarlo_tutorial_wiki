# Objectives
Perturbate floating-point data and operations to estimate rounding error.

# Description
Verificarlo generate an executable where floating-point operations are replaced with calls to functions.
These functions can perform various analyses and are distributed as dynamic libraries also named **backend** according to their features. They are loaded with the environment variable `VFC_BACKENDS`.

The available backend are
* `libinterflop_ieee.so`
* `libinterflop_mca.so`
* `ibinterflop_mca_mpfr.so`

Backends can be configured by passing command line arguments after each backend.

# Exercice 1: `libinterflop_ieee.so`
This is the simplest backend that emulates IEEE-754 arithmetic. 
It has a `--debug` option that trace each instrumented floating-point operations.


# Exercice 2: `libinterflop_mca.so`
To estimate the numerical error, we will now use the Monte Carlo Arithmetic backend (`libinterflop_mca.so`) in
single precision by simulating round-o errors that could occurs at 24 bits of precision.


# Exercice 3: `libinterflop_mca_mpfr.so`

# Exercice 4: Combination of back-end
Multiple backends can be loaded at the same time; they will be chained in the order of appearance in the VFC_BACKENDS variable. They must be separated with semi-colons,
