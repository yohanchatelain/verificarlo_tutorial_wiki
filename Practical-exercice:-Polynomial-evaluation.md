Polynomial evaluation is a common source of computational error. Polynomials are frequently used for function interpolation in libraries or user codes. As we will see, different evaluations of the same polynomial do not have the same behavior in terms of performance or numerical accuracy.

This tutorial uses the Tchebychev polynomial from ~\cite[pp.52-54]{parker1997monte}:
