# Objectives
Use Verificarlo to determine a proper termination criteria.

# Exercice
We use the following program to compute the golden ratio using the fact that the golden ratio is solution of the equation `x^2=x+1` : 

|golden.c|
|---------|
```C
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
#define MAXITER 200


int main(){
  double xi, xii, golden_ratio;
  int i;
  xi=2;
  golden_ratio = (1+sqrt(5))/2;

  printf(" i \t x \t err \n");
  for(i=0; i<MAXITER; i++){
    xii=sqrt(xi+1);
    printf("%d \t %.18e \t %.18e \n",i,xi,(xi-golden_ratio)/golden_ratio);
 
    xi=xii;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
1. In iterative process it is usually difficult to determine when to stop. Using Verificarlo can you detect starting from when it is not necessary to continue ?

2. In many iterative process the stopping criteria is achieved when the difference between two iterations is less than a multiple of the epsilon machine (`__DBL_EPSILON__`). Modify the program so that it will stop when the relative difference between two iterations is less than 4 times the epsilon machine.

3. As mentioned before, we used the fact that golden ratio is solution of the equation `x^2=x+1` and the iteration `xii=sqrt(xi+1)`. But what would have happened if we would have used `xii=xi*xi-1` instead, is it a better iteration ?
