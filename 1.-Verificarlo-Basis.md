# Verificarlo Basis
To debug or optimize floating-point computation with Verificarlo, the first
step is to compile your program with it. Verificarlo is built as a set of LLVM
plugins; to compile a program with verificarlo you should use the _verificarlo_
command instead of the usual _clang_, _icc_ or _gcc_.

Once a program is compiled with Verificarlo, you can load various backends to
simulate round-off noise or the effect of lower floating-point precisions. Backends are selected and configured by defining the _VFC\_BACKENDS_ environment variable.

This tutorial will guide you through examples on how to use Verificarlo. 
If necessary, you can access an online documentation at <https://github.com/verificarlo/verificarlo>.

In this tutorial, we will use the docker container available at
<https://hub.docker.com/r/verificarlo/verificarlo/>.
To pull the latest container with verificarlo and start working with it on
the tutorial workspace type the following commands,

    $ wget <address of verificarlo-tutorial.tar.gz>
    $ tar xzvf verificarlo-tutorial.tar.gz
    $ cd verificarlo-tutorial/
    $ docker pull verificarlo/verificarlo
    $ docker run -v $PWD:/workdir -it verificarlo/verificarlo bash
